# Publishing on Flathub

Notes for the maintainer. Flathub reviews each new app, and its rules matter here:

## Rules that affect this project (check docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/requirements; they change)

- **App id.** Projects hosted on GitHub must use `io.github.<user>.<App>`. This project uses `io.github.evandro777.FastSync`, and the
  id must equal the `<id>` in the metainfo.
- **AI policy.** Submitters must disclose AI-generated code, documentation or packaging. **Flathub manifests must not contain
  AI-generated or AI-assisted content**, and AI tools or agents must not open or automate the submission pull request. If an
  AI assistant wrote any of this project's code, docs or in-repo `flatpak/` files, then:
    - **Write the Flathub manifest yourself**, by hand (you may read `flatpak/io.github.evandro777.FastSync.yml` to understand it, but
      do not paste it).
    - **Open the submission PR yourself**, and disclose the AI assistance for the code and docs in it.
- **No network during the build.** Dependencies must be declared as sources. For Rust that means a `cargo-sources.json` from
  [`flatpak-cargo-generator.py`](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/tree/master/cargo) and `Cargo.lock`,
  referenced from the manifest (the in-repo manifest vendors crates with `cargo vendor` instead, which Flathub will not take).
- **Permissions as small as possible.** Be ready to say why each `finish-args` entry is needed.
- **Metainfo must validate** (`appstreamcli validate`), with screenshots served over HTTPS (for example
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandro777/FastSync/master/docs/screenshots/main.png`), a license, release notes and an OARS
  content rating. The icon is the SVG in `packaging/`.
- The submission goes to [flathub/flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub) as a pull request against the `new-pr` branch;
  after approval the app gets its own `flathub/io.github.evandro777.FastSync` repo, and updates are PRs there.

## Checklist before submitting

- [ ] Repository is public with a release tag and the metainfo URLs resolve (homepage, bugtracker, screenshots).
- [ ] The Flatpak builds and runs from a clean machine (`flatpak/build.sh --devel`).
- [ ] `cargo-sources.json` generated and builds offline.
- [ ] Hand-written Flathub manifest, with the AI disclosure in the PR text if it applies.

## Until then

The signed Flatpak remote on GitHub Pages (`flatpak.yml`) is the distribution channel, with the bundle on GitHub Releases.
